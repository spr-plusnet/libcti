/**
 * 
 *         The Call Received event is sent when a subscriber receives an
 *         incoming call.
 * 
 *         For subscriptions to the Advanced Call 2 event package, the event is
 *         generated prior to service processing (e.g. CFA).
 * 
 *         For subscriptions to the Basic Call event package or the Advanced Call
 *         event package, the event is generated after service processing.
 *         If the call is forwarded to a new destination, or rejected
 *         without alerting the user's device(s) (e.g. do not disturb),
 *         then the event is not generated.
 * 
 *         This event is also generated in cases where the subscriber is being
 *         recalled (e.g. call transfer recall). It contains information on
 *         the caller in the remoteParty parameter.
 * 
 *         The call state is Alerting and the personality is terminator.
 *       
 *
