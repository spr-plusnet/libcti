/**
 * 
 *         Contains the Call Forwarding Always Secondary (CFAS) service configuration data.
 *         Call Forwarding Always Secondary allows you to forward all your incoming calls to a different
 *         phone number or SIP-URI, such as your home office or cell phone. You can also
 *         make your primary phone emit a short ring burst to inform you if you are next to your
 *         phone when the call is forwarded by using the Ring Reminder. This is important
 *         when you have forgotten the service is turned on and you are at your primary
 *         phone waiting to receive calls. Note that the address (phone number or SIP-URI) you forward
 *         your calls to must be permitted by your outgoing calling plan.
