/**
 * 
 *         The Call Held event is generated when the subscriber or the remote
 *         party holds the call. The event indicates whether the call was
 *         held by the subscriber or remote party. The call state is Held
 *         or Remote Held depending on which party held the call. Remote
 *         party call hold is only reported for group/enterprise calls in a
 *         standalone application. Also, if the call is already held
 *         locally, then the remote party call hold is not reported.
 *
