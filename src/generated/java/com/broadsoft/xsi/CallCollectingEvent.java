/**
 * 
 * 
 *         The Call Collecting event is generated when BroadWorks needs to collect
 *         information by interacting with a subscriber. This event
 *         generated in two types of situation:
 * 
 *         i) When programming a service through a Feature Access Code. This
 *         happens for instance when a subscriber activates Call Forward
 *         Always.
 *         ii)When BroadWorks requires some information before calling the remote
 *         party. This happens for instance when a subscriber invoke the
 *         Calling Line ID Blocking service before dialing. This can also
 *         happen when BroadWorks require an authentication or accounting
 *         code before calling the remote party. Note that in these cases,
 *         the Call Collecting event is not generated if the service
 *         activation precedes the setup of a call and the destination is
 *         already known from the dialed digits.
 * 
 * 
 *         The callId and externalTrackingId is generated when the call is
 *         established with BroadWorks and included in the event. The call
 *         state is Active and the personality is originator. The address
 *         parameter of the remoteParty is set to the dialed digits.
