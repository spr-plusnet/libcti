/**
 * 
 *         The Call Updated event is generated when call attributes are
 *         modified,with the call state not being modified. Examples of
 *         such updates are: remote party information changes, local
 *         endpoint changes, personality changes. Local endpoint changes
 *         occurs if for instance a subscriber has multiple access
 *         endpoints and performs a Call Retrieve from a phone, then the
 *         AccessEndpoint is expected to be modified. A Personality change
 *         can occur during a Directed Call Pickup with Barge-in
 *         As a result, a remote application must inspect the various field of
 *         the Call Updated event to determine what change occurred since
 *         the last notification.
 *       
 *
