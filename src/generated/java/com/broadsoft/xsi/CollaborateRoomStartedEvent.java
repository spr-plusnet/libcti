/**
 * 
 *         Sent whenever a collaboration starts.
 *         A room starts when the first participant joins unless the owner required 
 *         to start room option is selected for the room, in which case the room does 
 *         not start until a owner joins the room.
 *         
 *         Note that rooms can be started more than once.  Each time a room starts it 
 *         initializes the room information according to the configuration of the room.
 *         It is possible for a conference to require a owner before starting.  In this 
 *         case, any other participants who connect prior to the moderator joining are 
 *         placed on hold. Only when an owner joins is a CollaborateRoomStartedEvent sent. 
 *         It is followed by a join event that contains a list of the participants who 
 *         have now entered the call, including the owner.
 *
